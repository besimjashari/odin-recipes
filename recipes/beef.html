    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the best beef stroganoff recipe I know. It's well worth the effort. I have been making this for over 20 years!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 ounces butter</li>
        <li>4 green onions, sliced (white parts only)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared mustard</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white wine</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove any fat and gristle from chuck roast; cut into strips 1/2-inch thick by 2-inches long. Season with ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef and brown quickly; push to one side of the skillet. Add onions; cook and stir for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with beef.</li>
        <li>Stir flour into juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and stir in mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the beef is tender.</li>
        <li>Five minutes before serving, stir in mushrooms, sour cream, and white wine. Cook until heated through; season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
